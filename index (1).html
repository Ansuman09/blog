      <p>The aim of this project was to create a recommendation system that will help users to select the next book to read. The following project was inspired from a quote of Carl Sagan a renowned astrophysicist .</p>

      <h2>What is Collaborative Filtering ?</h2>
      <h4>Collaborative filtering uses algorithms to filter data from user reviews to make personalized recommendations for users with similar preferences. The algorithm used here is called as the Cosine Similarity</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="container text-holder">
      <p><strong>Cosine Similarity: </strong>Cosine similarity is a function that determines how closely are any to vectors given in an n-dimensional space related. Thus any two vectors are said to be similar if the cosine of the two vectors is close to 1 i.e. 0° or a value of 0 if they are not similar.

      <p>This dataset available on Kaggle was useful in creating the website and the recommendation system.</p>

    <div class="container text-holder">
      <p>So as you can see if the books are similar then the value is close to one since a book is exactly same as itself it’s similarity is equal to one in the matrix.

      <h4>ADDITIONAL CHANGES TO THE RECCOMENDER SYSTEM.</h4>
      <p><strong>Issue:</strong> Since the recommender system built here just generates the similar movies given one input value i.e. the latest choice of the user, it completely forgets about the previous choices of the user.</p>
<p><strong>Changes:</strong> Here a function was created to instruct to predict by taking the average of the past 25% percent of the data and some parts of the previous data i.e. recommended books are more dependent on the latest user choices and a small amount on some of the previous user choices which was selected randomly.
